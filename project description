Title: Window Grids & Floor Cleaner With HI-FI Charger
Description: 
Cleaning the window in the building is a difficult task nowadays. Glass climbing robots have been utilized for cleaning the window in developed countries. The robot is used to climb the glass and clean the window automatically. In this proposal, a new method has been introduced to design a system for the easy cleaning of windows and its grids at low cost. The system has to be turned on semi automatically. The system also has a battery for power backup and the battery will be charged by a charger which is also works with new idea. Further, the charger can also be used for mobile phones and all other systems required charging. 
                     While charging the system (mobile phone), the completion time of 100% charging is not known by the user while it is connected during sleeping time. Unnecessary charging of battery beyond the full value (after attaining 100%) will harm the battery and device. Hence, the proposal also includes a new design of charger that automatically switch off power supply for charger when battery gets fully charged and it prevent the short circuits,high and low voltage effects.Therefore the charger saves the power and prevent the system andits charging circuit.
